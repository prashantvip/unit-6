1.What is Caching? How can you save money with Caching?
A cache's primary purpose is to increase data retrieval performance by reducing the need to access the underlying 
slower storage layer. Trading off capacity for speed, a cache typically stores a 
subset of data transiently, in contrast to databases whose data is usually complete and durable.
2.What is load balancing?
Load balancing refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers, also known as a 
server farm or server pool.
3.What is CAP Theorem?
 It is a tool used to make system designers aware of the trade-offs while designing networked shared-data systems. 
 The CAP theorem states that it is not possible to guarantee all three of the desirable properties â€“ consistency, availability, 
 and partition tolerance at the same time in a distributed system with data replication
 4.What is PACELC Theorem?
 the PACELC theorem is an extension to the CAP theorem. It states that in case of network partitioning (P) in a distributed computer system, 
 one has to choose between availability (A) and consistency (C) (as per the CAP theorem), 
 but else (E), even when the system is running normally in the absence of partitions, one has to choose between latency (L) and consistency (C).
